# About us.
MechaPower is a media group focused on creating art, music, games and many more. We like to help out people new to join the media industry and are very easy to work with. We hope you'll find what you're looking for, either finding music or art that you like or join our team. We are glad to accept new members no matter where are you from just as long as you speak English.

We provide help with music distribution, top-level domain email (@mechapower.eu) and a friendly enviroment to work together in (Discord server).
