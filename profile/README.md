We hope you'll find what you're looking for, either finding music or art that you like or join our team. We are glad to accept new members no matter where are you from just as long as you speak English.

We provide help with music distribution, top-level domain email (@mechapower.eu) and a friendly enviroment to work together in (Discord server).
